abstract: Automation is accelerating the discovery of useful materials, yet testing
  even a small fraction of the billions of possible materials for a desired property
  is beyond the reach of workflows involving resource-intensive property measurements.
  Due to relationships among composition, structure, and properties, identifying a
  complex material with one interesting property makes it the proverbial needle in
  a haystack that merits testing for additional properties. We accelerate materials
  synthesis and optical characterization by employing physics-aware data science to
  identify materials for further investigation. With this approach, one does not need
  high-throughput methods for measuring every material property of interest since
  a single ultra-highâ€“throughput workflow can guide material selection for other properties,
  which is a new paradigm for accelerated materials discovery.The quest to identify
  materials with tailored properties is increasingly expanding into high-order composition
  spaces, with a corresponding combinatorial explosion in the number of candidate
  materials. A key challenge is to discover regions in composition space where materials
  have novel properties. Traditional predictive models for material properties are
  not accurate enough to guide the search. Herein, we use high-throughput measurements
  of optical properties to identify novel regions in three-cation metal oxide composition
  spaces by identifying compositions whose optical trends cannot be explained by simple
  phase mixtures. We screen 376,752 distinct compositions from 108 three-cation oxide
  systems based on the cation elements Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, In, Sn, Ce, and Ta.
  Data models for candidate phase diagrams and three-cation compositions with emergent
  optical properties guide the discovery of materials with complex phase-dependent
  properties, as demonstrated by the discovery of a Co-Ta-Sn substitutional alloy
  oxide with tunable transparency, catalytic activity, and stability in strong acid
  electrolytes. These results required close coupling of data validation to experiment
  design to generate a reliable end-to-end high-throughput workflow for accelerating
  scientific discovery.The optical absorption spectra, fitted phase diagrams, and
  mixture probabilities have been deposited in Google Cloud Storage (http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/metal-oxide-spectroscopy/README.txt;
